                            <p>Why love corn dogs?</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The batter is straightforward, and there is no need to wait for the batter to cool down. It can be used right away.</li>
                                <li>In this case, you can make the batter up to two days in advance if you want. You can also keep the extra batter in the fridge so you can fry something new the next day.</li>
                                <li>Skip the corn starch. You don't need to dip the hot dogs in corn starch to make them crispy. To make the batter stick to the corndogs, all you need to do is dry them off with paper towels.</li>
                                <li>Freezer-friendly: You can make these, cool them down to room temperature, and then put them in a freezer-safe Ziploc bag to keep them safe.</li>
                                <li>You can defrost them in the refrigerator or microwave them for 30 seconds. Then you can put them in an air fryer or a skillet and cook them until they're crispy on the outside, like in an air fryer or on a skillet.</li>

                        <p class="light">Let us immediately begin! It may seem like a lot to purchase at first. Still, most of the components become staples [like sriracha + sesame seeds], and non-perishables like nori, sushi rice, and vinegar will last in your cupboard for an absurdly long time. You'll get 4-6 sushi dinners for the price of one in a restaurant. Above all, it's a lot of fun! Invite a few pals over and let your hair down.
                            <br> Additionally, this is one of the rare occasions when it is socially appropriate to say, "Here is everything you need; now prepare your own dinner!" Arrange all of your ingredients on a table and invite your friends and family to build their own rolls!
                            <br> I'll walk you through each step and then give you a downloadable cheat sheet at the end to simplify your new sushi journey even more!

                        <h2>RAMEN</h2>
                        <p class="light">Making ramen from scratch is a somewhat involved process. It can be a multiday endeavor, and if you lack the time, it can be pretty scary. 
                          (No, this time, we are not creating our own noodles... For the time being, I'm going easy on you.) Our shoyu ramen recipe requires the preparation of four critical components: 
                          dashi and tare for the soup base and nitamago and chashu for the show-stopping toppings. While you can absolutely eat a great bowl of noodles without one or two of these characters, 
                          magic happens when they all come together in one mouthful. Do not be afraid; your patience will be rewarded.</p>

                        <p class="ml-3">Instructions</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Rub salt on pork and let it sit overnight in the fridge.</li>
                            <li>In a pot, put water, ginger root, garlic, green onions and salted pork, and boil at high heat. Skim fat and other floating scums. Then cover, reduce to low heat, and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Let the broth and pork cool completely in pot. Strain and save pork. Slice pork and set aside for a topping.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the rest of the toppings now as well (boiled eggs, blanched bean sprouts, cut green onions), before making the soup and noodles. Once the noodles are cooked, you will need to add the soup and toppings right away or the noodles will get soft, so you won't have time to prepare the toppings at the end.</li>
                            <li>Boil the broth and add soy sauce, sake, salt and sesame oil. Let it simmer at very low heat until noodles are ready.</li>
                            <li>In boiling water in a pot, add baking soda (be careful, it may boil over), then add the fresh angel hair pasta. Cook the pasta for 30 seconds, and strain. Immediately divide noodles into bowls and add soup onto noodles. Top with boiled eggs, bean sprouts, green onions and sliced pork.</li>

                        <p class="light">What is there not to appreciate about pork sinigang or the dish as a whole? 
                            I grew up enjoying its numerous variations, and it has remained a favorite of mine to this day. 
                            There is something about this popular Filipino dish that draws people back to it repeatedly. 
                            Personally, I enjoy the sensation I get from sipping the hot sour broth. 
                            It provides me with a sense of security and warmth during the winter. 
                            It also has the same calming effect on me when I eat it on hot summer days, but the warm broth 
                            somehow makes me feel cool literally.

                            <li>1 kilo Pork into small chunk cubes you can now buy Pork Sinigang cut in Supermarkets</li>
                            <li>2 medium size onion quartered</li>
                            <li>2 medium size tomato quartered</li>
                            <li>1 radish sliced diagonally</li>

                            <li>3 Siling haba</li>
                            <li>Salt or Patis</li>

                        <p class="ml-3">Instructions</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash the pork cubes thoroughly. Put in a large pot, cover with enough water then let it stay there for 5 to 10 minutes, this process will lessen the scum that rises to the surface when you boil the meat. Now throw the reddish water after minutes.</li>
                            <li>Add water again enough to cover the meat and bring to a boil, and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until pork meat are tender. Take out all scum that rises to the surface.</li>
                            <li>When adding more water, make sure you add boiling water not just tap water, adding tap water will cause the meat shrink back.</li>
                            <li>When the meat is already tender add gabi (taro root), and simmer for 8-10 minutes or until gabi are tender and start to disintegrate.</li>
                            <li>Add onion, tomato and sinigang mix and simmer for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Season with salt or patis (fish sauce). Add in eggplant, sitaw, and radish, cook for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Then add kangkong leaves and sili haba.</li>
                            <li>Cook for another 2 minutes or until vegetables are cooked. Serve hot.</li>

                        <h2>QUESODILLA</h2>
                        <p class="light">Quesadillas are a quick and easy dish to prepare. Arrange a tortilla on a heated skillet, brown it, flip it over, and fill it with cheese and desired toppings. 
                            When the ingredients are thoroughly warmed and the tortilla is browned correctly, fold it over and remove it from the grill. <br> 
                            <em>A word of caution when putting meat in a quesadilla: the cooking time may not be long enough to thoroughly heat the meat. You may wish to warm it beforehand.</em><br>
                            Historically, corn tortillas have been used. However, flour tortillas are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in the United States. Additionally, most quesadillas in Mexico are stuffed with Oaxaca cheese, a stringy Mexican cheese. 
                            It has a mild, buttery flavor comparable to Monterey jack, but the texture and meltability are more akin to mozzarella. We use a blend of Monterey jack and cheddar cheese in our chicken quesadillas, but you may use any melty cheese you choose. 
                            Our most important piece of advice: Do not fret if cheese spills onto the pan. The crispy, almost charred portions (a.k.a. frico) impart an unmatched salty, fatty crunch.

                            <li>Heat oil in a nonstick skillet, add one tortilla. Layer with half the cheddar cheese, all of the chicken and mushrooms and half the Monterey Jack cheese. Top with the second tortilla. Cover and heat until cheese melts and bottom tortilla is crisp and golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Turn over; sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Cook until bottom tortilla is crisp and golden brown and cheese is melted. Cut into wedges; serve with sour cream and salsa if desired.</li>

                        <h2>COOKIES</h2>
                        <p class="light"> My website's most popular cookie recipe is for these incredibly soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies. Melted butter, a higher proportion of brown sugar to white sugar, and an additional egg yolk ensure the chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture possible. Large chocolate chunks ensure that each bite contains chocolate. These cookies have an unmatched flavor and texture. There is no need for a mixer!
                            <br> There are countless chocolate chip cookie recipes available online. Each person has a favorite! However, this dish truly shines out, in my opinion.

                        <ul>
                            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                            <li>Fine salt</li>
                            <li>1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                            <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
                            <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>

                            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                            <li>One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="ml-3">Directions</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Position 2 racks in the center of the oven, and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.</li>
                            <li>Whisk together the flour, baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.</li>
                            <li>Beat the butter and both sugars on medium-high speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld mixer) until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. 
                                Add the eggs, one at time, beating after each addition to incorporate. Beat in the vanilla. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed. Reduce the speed to medium, add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. 
                                Stir in the chocolate chips.
                            </li>
                            <li>Scoop 12 heaping tablespoons of dough about 2 inches apart onto each prepared baking sheet. Roll the dough into balls with slightly wet hands. Bake, rotating the cookie sheets from upper to lower racks halfway through, 
                                until golden but still soft in the center, 12 to 15 minutes (the longer the cook time, the crunchier the cookies). Let cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet, and then transfer to a rack to cool completely.
                            </li>
                            <li>Let the baking sheets cool completely, scoop the remaining dough onto 1 sheet and bake. Store the cookies in a tightly sealed container at room temperature for up to 5 days.</li>

                        <p class="light">This popular Middle Eastern street meal consists of extensively marinated pork (or chicken) piled on a vertical rotisserie or spit and slowly cooked for days until perfectly tender and tasty! 
                            To serve, thin strips of meat are shaved from the spit and heaped into a warm pita pocket along with a heaping helping of fresh garnishes and a generous drizzle of tahini sauce. All you need for this simple
                            homemade shawarma recipe is a large skillet or cast iron grill pan. And to ensure we achieve the most authentic texture and flavor of beef shawarma, thinly slice your meat and sprinkle it in the savory shawarma

                        <h2>CHICKEN ALFREDO</h2>
                        <p class="light"> Chicken alfredo, oh chicken alfredo: it's the classic pasta dish we can't get enough of. Of course, you can purchase jarred pasta sauces, but making alfredo sauce from scratch is incredibly simple.
                            <br> This is an excellent starting point for all of your one-pot pasta needs. Consider the following revisions if you're feeling adventurous. 
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>If you prefer a more decadent sauce, replace the milk with heavy cream or half and a half—never a wrong move.</li>
                            <li>Are you a fan of dark meat? Replace thighs with breasts! Simply ensure that you allow ample cooking time for them. Thighs take significantly longer to cook in the pan and actually benefit from a quick trip to the oven. 
                                Our garlic butter-baked chicken thighs employ this technique and are absolutely delectable.
                            </li>
                            <li>Experiment with different types of noodles: fettuccini is a traditional choice, but angel hair or spaghetti will work just as well! Simply ensure that the pasta you choose is completely immersed in the cooking liquid.</li>
                            <li>Do you feel as though you could use some vegetables? After the pasta is cooked, stir in a couple of large handfuls of spinach and some halved grape tomatoes.</li>
                            <li>If you're missing some crunch, toast some panko bread crumbs with butter in a skillet and garnish with a handful. This technique works with any pasta; the added texture elevates it to new heights.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p class="ml-3">Ingredients</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>8 ounces dried fettuccine pasta</li>
                            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound total)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
                            <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) European-style unsalted butter, divided</li>
                            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                            <li>1 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese (2 1/2 ounces), plus more for serving</li>
                            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
                            <li>Coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves, for serving</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="ml-3">Directions</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cook the pasta, drain, and reserve cooking water. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
                            <li>Dry the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, pat both sides of the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Season with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.</li>
                            <li>Heat the oil over medium-high in a large frying pan. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering, 2 to 3 minutes. If you have a pan that has straight sides, here's the time to use it. Do not use a nonstick pan.</li>
                            <li>Add the chicken to the hot pan, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Swirl the pan just before adding the chicken to distribute the oil. Add the chicken and leave it alone for 5 to 7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. If you try to to turn the chicken and it feels stuck, it isn't ready to flip.</li>
                            <li>Flip the chicken and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the chicken reaches 165°F. Flip the chicken over and add 1 tablespoon of the butter right between them. Pick up the pan and give it a gentle swirl to distribute the melting butter. Cook the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
                            <li>Slice the chicken and cover to keep warm. Transfer the chicken to a plate or clean cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cover with aluminum foil while you prepare the rest of the dish.</li>
                            <li>Melt the rest of the butter and sauté the garlic. Add the remaining 7 tablespoons butter to the same pan used for the chicken and place over medium heat until melted. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
                            <li>Make the Alfredo sauce. Whisk in the cream, Parmesan, nutmeg, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.</li>
                            <li>Add the drained pasta and toss to coat in the sauce. Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce and toss to coat. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>

                        <p class="light">Gimbap (occasionally spelled "kimbap") is the ideal on-the-go meal, a common sight at bus stops, and a must-have at school picnics. 
                            The only constraint on kimbap fillings is your creativity: Tuna, avocado, chicken, shrimp, and bulgogi kimbap are all available. Essentially, you may add whatever you wish to the roll.
                            However, for this recipe, I'm going to introduce the most common ingredients for a traditional Korean kimbap roll, including imitation crab stick, ham, pickled radish, braised burdock root, egg, carrot, fishcake, and cucumber.
                        </p> <br>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Seasoning the cucumber with salt draws out excess moisture.</li>
                            <li>Sautéing some of the ingredients softens them just enough to facilitate the formation and consumption of the rolls.</li>

                            <li>Place freshly made rice in a large, shallow bowl. Gently mix in ½ teaspoon kosher salt and 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil over top with a rice scoop or a wooden spoon.</li>
                            <li>Let it cool down enough so it’s no longer steaming. Cover and set aside.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p class="ml-4">Spinach:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Combine the blanched spinach, 2 minced garlic cloves, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil in a bowl.</li>
                            <li>Mix well by hand and put it on a large platter with the sliced yellow pickled radish.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Combine the carrot matchsticks with ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Mix well and let it sweat for 5 to 10 minutes. Heat a pan and add a few drops vegetable oil.</li>
                            <li>Squeeze out excess water from the carrot, then saute for about 1 minute. Put it on the platter next to the spinach.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p class="ml-4">Steaks:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Trim the fat from the skirt steaks and slice into ¼ inch wide, 3 to 5 inch strips. Put the strips into a bowl. Add 2 teaspoons soy sauce, 1 minced garlic clove, ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper,1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon brown (or white) sugar, and 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil.</li>
                            <li>Mix well by hand.</li>
                            <li>Set aside, and let them marinate while we do the egg strips.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Crack 3 eggs in a bowl and add ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Beat it with fork and remove the stringy chalaza.</li>
                            <li>Drizzle a few drops of oil on a heated 10 to 12 inch non-stick pan. Wipe off the excess with a paper towel so only a thin sheen of oil remains. Turn down the heat to low and pour the egg mixture into the pan. Spread it into a large circle so it fills the pan.</li>
                            <li>When the bottom of the egg is cooked, flip it over with a spatula. Remove from the heat and let it cook slowly in the hot pan for about 5 minutes, with the ultimate goal of keeping the egg as yellow as possible, and not brown.</li>
                            <li>Cut it into ½ inch wide strips. Put it next to the spinach on the platter.</li>

                            <li>Set aside.</li>

                        </ol>

                        <p class="ml-4">Rolling Kimbap:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Place a sheet of gim on a bamboo mat with the shiny side down. Evenly spread about ¾ cup of cooked rice over top of it, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on one side of the gim.</li>
                            <li>Place beef, carrot, yellow pickled radish strip, a few egg strips, and spinach in the center of the rice.</li>
                            <li>Use both hands to roll the mat (along with gim and rice) over the fillings, so one edge of the rice and gim reaches the opposite edge. This centers the fillings in the roll, so they'll be nicely in the middle when you slice it.</li>
                            <li>Grab the mat with both hands and and press it tightly as you continue rolling the kimbap. Push out the mat as you roll, so it doesn't get wrapped in the kimbap.</li>
                            <li>Remove the roll from the mat at the end and set the finished roll aside with the seam down, to seal it nicely.</li>
                            <li>Repeat 4 more times with the remaining ingredients.</li>
                            <li>Put some toasted sesame oil on the finished rolls and sprinkle some sesame seeds over top. Cut each roll into ¼ inch bite size pieces with a sharp knife, occasionally wiping it with a wet paper towel or cloth to clean the starch off and to ease cutting.</li>
                            <li>Put it on a plate and serve immediately or pack it in a lunchbox.</li>

                        <h2>PUTO BUMBONG</h2>
                        <p class="light"> Puto bumbong is a type of purple rice cake indigenous to the Philippines. It is made by steaming ground purple rice mixture inside a bamboo tube. 
                            In Filipino, the tube is referred to as "bumbong ng kawayan." This may have been the reason for the title. Puto bumbong is a traditional snack following Simbang Gabi distinguished 
                            by steaming cookers with multiple bamboo chimneys. These specialized cookers are likely to deter anyone from making puto bumbong at home. <br> 
                            This recipe for puto bumbong is the best we've come up with in an attempt to recreate the good old traditional puto bumbong from the days. Before, purple yam (ube) was used as an alternative ingredient.

                        <h2>ADOBO</h2>
                        <p class="light">Chicken adobo is a traditional Filipino dish that predates any external influence. This version is based on a more contemporary rendition, which incorporates soy sauce for savory depth 
                            and rice vinegar for the adobo's signature acidity. While browning the meat is optional, it adds depth of flavor to both the chicken and the sauce, which you can further enhance by broiling the braised chicken after it is fully cooked.
                            <br> Chicken adobo is comfort food for people of all ages due to the flavor of juicy chicken in a succulent, umami adobo sauce. From children to adults, we can't get enough of this delectable dish!

                        <p>Suggestions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Browning the chicken and deglaze the pan with water infuses both the meat and the sauce with an additional layer of savory flavor.</li>
                            <li>When the garlic and bay leaves are bloom in the rendered chicken fat, their aromatic oils are released into the sauce.</li>
